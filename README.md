The Capel Shire President Michael Southwell touted that the new Shire Council under his leadership would be open and accountable. However, what is happening is that the process now seems to be unprofessional and counterproductive with this new radical approach and it is not working.

The Shire of Capel councillors were not expecting some very intense moments from ratepayers and residents expressing their feelings towards the current new brand of councillors.

The current council with the new leadership needs to think things through thoroughly as a lot of ratepayers and residents are not amused especially with what is going on with staff allegedly being bullied by some councillors per se.


•	the shire president has to understand that this is not a newspaper that he is running it is the lowest tier of State government and the residents of Capel have never witnessed such arrogance as displayed by the president without any measure of regret.

•	the president should remove himself from the position with tact and diplomacy as he is sabotaging his efforts by continuously calling special meetings and then after the masses cause pandemonium, he locks them out of the meetings.
 
•	the presidents latest baby is making unfair demands whereby he wants an independent lawyer of his choosing to oversee an investigation into the alleged bullying which I see as hindering the Worksafe officers in the execution of their duty, and the CEO has tried to tell the president what he is doing is in effect a breach of the Local Government Act 1995, but he doesn’t listen.
 
•	his majesty is not doing himself any favours in the shire of Capel as his spontaneous side goes into overdrive, with his selfish attitude, and has endured several reprimands from the Local Government Standards Panel, but he continues without batting an eyelid.
